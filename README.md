🌟 Leveling Up My Frontend Skills with a New React Project! 🌟

Over the past few days, I worked on building a Food Court UI using React.js, focusing on writing clean and reusable components. This project helped me understand how real-world applications handle data, render UI dynamically, and maintain design consistency.

🛠️ What I built:
I created a simple yet eye-catchy interface that displays a list of food items using React components, props, and dynamic arrays. Each food card contains:
🍽️ Food Name
📸 Image
🏷️ Price
🏨 Hotel Name
📝 Description

I also designed a cursive-style header and applied styling to ensure all cards maintain a consistent look and feel.

💡 What I learned:
✔️ How to structure a React project efficiently
✔️ Breaking UI into small, reusable components
✔️ Passing data using props
✔️ Styling strategies in React (inline, external CSS)
✔️ Creating responsive and uniform cards
✔️ Writing maintainable and clean code

🚀 Why I built this:
I strongly believe learning happens through doing, so I’m building multiple hands-on mini-projects to gain confidence in frontend development. This small project helped me get more comfortable with React fundamentals and UI building.
